## Challenge
The setuid binary at /home/flag10/flag10 binary will upload any file given, as long as it meets the requirements of the access() system call.

## Solution
```c
#include <stdlib.h>
#include <unistd.h>
#include <sys/types.h>
#include <stdio.h>
#include <fcntl.h>
#include <errno.h>
#include <sys/socket.h>
#include <netinet/in.h>
#include <string.h>

int main(int argc, char **argv)
{
  char *file;
  char *host;

  if(argc < 3) {
      printf("%s file host\n\tsends file to host if you have access to it\n", argv[0]);
      exit(1);
  }

  file = argv[1];
  host = argv[2];

  if(access(argv[1], R_OK) == 0) {
      int fd;
      int ffd;
      int rc;
      struct sockaddr_in sin;
      char buffer[4096];

      printf("Connecting to %s:18211 .. ", host); fflush(stdout);

      fd = socket(AF_INET, SOCK_STREAM, 0);

      memset(&sin, 0, sizeof(struct sockaddr_in));
      sin.sin_family = AF_INET;
      sin.sin_addr.s_addr = inet_addr(host);
      sin.sin_port = htons(18211);

      if(connect(fd, (void *)&sin, sizeof(struct sockaddr_in)) == -1) {
          printf("Unable to connect to host %s\n", host);
          exit(EXIT_FAILURE);
      }

#define HITHERE ".oO Oo.\n"
      if(write(fd, HITHERE, strlen(HITHERE)) == -1) {
          printf("Unable to write banner to host %s\n", host);
          exit(EXIT_FAILURE);
      }
#undef HITHERE

      printf("Connected!\nSending file .. "); fflush(stdout);

      ffd = open(file, O_RDONLY);
      if(ffd == -1) {
          printf("Damn. Unable to open file\n");
          exit(EXIT_FAILURE);
      }

      rc = read(ffd, buffer, sizeof(buffer));
      if(rc == -1) {
          printf("Unable to read from file: %s\n", strerror(errno));
          exit(EXIT_FAILURE);
      }

      write(fd, buffer, rc);

      printf("wrote file!\n");

  } else {
      printf("You don't have access to %s\n", file);
  }
}
```
```console

Okay, let's read about the `access` system call.
```console
man 2 access
```
```
NAME
       access - check real user's permissions for a file

SYNOPSIS
       #include <unistd.h>

       int access(const char *pathname, int mode);

DESCRIPTION
       access()  checks whether the calling process can access the file pathname.  If path‚Äê
       name is a symbolic link, it is dereferenced.

       The mode specifies the accessibility check(s) to be performed,  and  is  either  the
       value F_OK, or a mask consisting of the bitwise OR of one or more of R_OK, W_OK, and
       X_OK.  F_OK tests for the existence of the file.  R_OK, W_OK, and X_OK test  whether
       the file exists and grants read, write, and execute permissions, respectively.

       The  check  is  done  using  the calling process's real UID and GID, rather than the
       effective IDs as is done when actually attempting an operation  (e.g.,  open(2))  on
       the  file.  This allows set-user-ID programs to easily determine the invoking user's
       authority.

       If the calling process is privileged (i.e., its real UID  is  zero),  then  an  X_OK
       check  is  successful for a regular file if execute permission is enabled for any of
       the file owner, group, or other.

RETURN VALUE
       On success (all requested permissions granted), zero  is  returned.   On  error  (at
       least  one  bit  in  mode asked for a permission that is denied, or some other error
       occurred), -1 is returned, and errno is set appropriately.
```
There's going to be a problem here, `flag10` checks for `R_OK` read access but `access` checks against the `real UID`.

`setuid` sets the `effective UID`, thus we will fail the check when entering `token` as the file.

But the `man` article has more to say:
```
NOTES
       Warning: Using access() to check if a user is authorized to,  for  example,  open  a
       file  before  actually  doing  so using open(2) creates a security hole, because the
       user might exploit the short time interval between checking and opening the file  to
       manipulate it.  For this reason, the use of this system call should be avoided.
```
Jackpot?

We can make `file` a `symbolic link` and change the link accordingly:
* `access()` - point to a file created by `level10`
* `open()` - point to `token`

Since we initiate the connection to `host` after calling `access()` we can
